The number of bins was chosen to be \num {1024} of logarithmic width. The IEEE conformant floats \gls {tensorfloat32}, \gls {binary16} and \gls {bfloat16} exhibit a simmilar shape, namely the distribution of numbers is exponential decreasing for higher and smaller numbers. The high numbers undergo a rough cutoff at the highest representable number. Numbers above that value will be cast to infinity. Compared to this, the small numbers show a smooth cutoff, because of the existence subnormal numbers. The range of \gls {posit16} is bigger than the range of \gls {binary16}, but specially in the very small numbers this difference in range is neglectible. Some features of posits can be observed: First, their distribution is symmetric around \num {1}, because posits have no subnormals. Second, more numbers are closer to \num {1} than in case of floats; the closer to \num {1}, the better the number resolution. Closest to \num {1}, the number resolution becomes better than \gls {binary16} resolution. Third, posits have no fixed-length mantissa nor exponent. That's the reason why the height of the posit shape depends on the number regime, which happens for floats only in the subnormal regime, where the exponent and mantissa are indeed of variable length. For all formats, the amount of numbers decreases exponentially when going away from \num {1}, but posits decrease faster. This suggests that when calculating in the number regime close to \num {1} posits might be the better choice, but when numbers span the whole number range equally, floats might be superior. But in that case one has to take care about over- and underflows. Notice that the height of the shape is determined by the number of mantissa bits, therefore giving the precision, whereas the width is determined by the number of exponent bits, therefore giving the number range. For example \gls {tensorfloat32} and \gls {binary16} have a very different number range, but exhibit the same percision for numbers in their intersection, meaning that \gls {binary16} is a subset of \gls {tensorfloat32}. On the other hand comparing \gls {tensorfloat32} and \gls {bfloat16} they have approximately the same number range, but different precisions in them, meaning that \gls {bfloat16} is as well a subset of \gls {tensorfloat32}, which itself is a subset of \gls {binary32}.
